Day 1 1. Defining variable 2. Matheamtical Operations 2.1 Mathematical Expression 3. Importing Libraries 4. Plotting simple function in python 4.1 Simple Plots 4.2 Adding Attributes in Plots 4.3 Saving Plots 5. More Things to Explore 6. References 1. Defining variable \u00b6 To define a varaible just choose a varaible name and asign it to a value using = as follows x = 24 # an integer pi = 3.14 # a float name = \"Sandeep Suman\" # a string Ex: Choose three variables and assign one as an integer, one as a float and one as a string, and print them. For example to print the name variable we use print ( name ) Sandeep Suman Tip The line after # got ignored by the python. It is called a comment in any programming language. You can use comment to add some instructions to the code. 2. Matheamtical Operations \u00b6 Mathematical operations, i.e., addition, substraction etc. can be done as 5 + 6 # addition 5 - 6 # substraction 5 * 6 # multiplication 5 / 6 # division 5 ** 6 # exponent or power Ex: Choose two variable x and y and assign each one as an integer. Try each of the above operations on them like x+y . Finally print them x = 2 y = 3 z = x + y print ( z ) 5 2.1 Mathematical Expression \u00b6 We can use these operations to evaluate complicated mathematical expressions in python, for example, we can compute f(x) = \\frac{x^2 + 1}{y-1} as follows x = 5 y = 3 z = ( x ** 2 + 1 ) / ( y - 1 ) print ( z ) 13 3. Importing Libraries \u00b6 To increase the functiionality of any language we use libraries or pre written code. A very useful library in python is called numpy which is used to do numerical calculation in python. In order to import a library in python you can use any of the following methods. import numpy # method 1 import numpy as np # method 2 from numpy import * # method 3 Any library has some function or variable included in them. for example numpy library has mathematical sine function as sin and the variable pi . For each method these things can be accessed as follows Method 1: In order to import the function and variable we will do the following import numpy print ( numpy . pi ) # prints the value of pi print ( numpy . sin ( numpy . pi )) # prints the sin(pi) Method 2: In order to import the function and variable we will do the following import numpy as np print ( np . pi ) # prints the value of pi print ( np . sin ( np . pi )) # prints the sin(pi) Method 3: In order to import the function and variable we will do the following from numpy import * print ( pi ) # prints the value of pi print ( sin ( pi )) # prints the sin(pi) Tip Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages but for this course we will use the second method only. 4. Plotting simple function in python \u00b6 To plot simple functions in python we use numpy and matplotlib libraries and three important functions. linspace from numpy The function linspace is used to generate a number of equidistant points on a line inteval. It takes three arguments. linspace(x,y,n) will generate a list of n points between x and y. Ex: Create 100 equally spaced points between -\\pi/2 and \\pi/2. plot from matplotlib.pyplot This is the function used to make a plot. It requires two argument. plot(x,y) will plot list of elements x versus y show from matplotlib.pyplot This function will show the final plot. It is simply invoked by typing show() 4.1 Simple Plots \u00b6 Now we have understood the basic components used to plot a function in python. Now we will see them together in a simple example by plotting the function \\sin(x) between -\\pi to \\pi . # 1. import necessary libraries import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # 2. generate a list of points in the given domain x = np . linspace ( - np . pi , np . pi , 100 ) # 3. apply the function on x y = np . sin ( x ) # 4. plot the y versus x plt . plot ( x , y ) # 5. show the plot plt . show () Ex: Plot the following function in the interval (1,10) \\sin^2(x) + \\cos(x) 2x^2 + 1 4.2 Adding Attributes in Plots \u00b6 The graph shows visual information in a small space in the form of an image. The representation can be improved by adding extra infomation like title legends and other things. These are called attributes. Modify the attributes of a plot like color, line width, line style by passing additional arguments. plt.plot(x, y, color='blue') this will make the graph blue Add title to a plot using title command. plt.title('Derivative Graph') this will make a title of the graph Incorporate LaTeX style formatting by adding a $ sign before and after the string. plt.plot(x,f(x),label='$f(x)=tan(x^2)$') Label x and y axes using xlabel() and ylabel() commands. plt . xlabel ( 'x values' ) plt . ylabel ( 'y values' ) Add annotations to a plot using annotate() command. Get and set the limits of axes using xlim() and ylim() commands. Tip Try to add one attribute at a time. Use plane english in double/single quotes. Example using all these attributes together: import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np . linspace ( - 20 , 20. , 250 ) y = np . sin ( x ) / x plt . plot ( x , y , color = 'red' , linestyle = 'dashed' ) plt . xlabel ( \"$x$-axis\" ) plt . ylabel ( r \"$y = \\frac{\\sin(x)} {x} $\" ) plt . legend ([ r \"$f(x)=\\frac{\\sin(x)} {x} $\" ]) plt . title ( r \"Topologist Sine Curve\" ) plt . show () Ex: Draw a plot of cosine graph between -2\\pi to 2\\pi with line thickness 4 in blue colour. 4.3 Saving Plots \u00b6 In order to save the plot in the local directory we use savefig function. The plot can be saved in the following format. pdf ps png svg eps To save the figure in currrent working directory use the code. plt . savefig ( \"myplot.png\" ) To save the plot of topologist sine curve I have used the following plt . savefig ( '/Users/ssuman/Downloads/topologist-sine.png' , dpi = 300 , bbox_inches = 'tight' ) 5. More Things to Explore \u00b6 Multiple plots We can plot more than one graphs togather as follows import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt x = np . linspace ( 0 , 2 * np . pi , 400 ) a = np . sin ( x ) b = np . cos ( x ) c = a + b # plot all the graphs together and labels can # be used to identify them plt . plot ( x , a , label = 'sin(x)' ) plt . plot ( x , b , label = 'cos(x)' ) plt . plot ( x , c , label = 'sin(x)+cos(x)' ) # adding attributes to the plot plt . xlabel ( 'x-axis' , fontsize = 20 ) plt . ylabel ( 'y-axis' , fontsize = 20 ) plt . title ( 'MULTIPLE GRAPH' , fontsize = 40 ) plt . legend () # save and display the graph plt . savefig ( 'multiplegraph.png' ) plt . show () Subplots Subplot is used to plot more than one plots in a bigger plot. 6.

Loading data from files \u00b6 To load the data from external text or CSV file we have to use loadtxt function from the numpy library. This function will store the column into the lists in python, which can be further processed in the program. 1.1 Single Column File \u00b6 A single comma separated row file can be read as the following. Let primes.txt stores the data consist of first 100 prime numbers separated by comma looks as the following 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, 131, 137, 139, 149, 151, 157, 163, 167, 173, 179, 181, 191, 193, 197, 199, 211, 223, 227, 229, 233, 239, 241, 251, 257, 263, 269, 271, 277, 281, 283, 293, 307, 311, 313, 317, 331, 337, 347, 349, 353, 359, 367, 373, 379, 383, 389, 397, 401, 409, 419, 421, 431, 433, 439, 443, 449, 457, 461, 463, 467, 479, 487, 491, 499, 503, 509, 521, 523, 541 To read this data and store all the values in a list named primes we use the following command, observe that data is separated by , . import numpy as np # loading primes in list, delimiter is used to separate data primes = np . loadtxt ( \"primes.txt\" , delimiter = ',' ) print ( primes ) [ 2. 3. 5. 7. 11. 13. 17. 19. 23. 29. 31. 37. 41. 43. 47. 53. 59. 61. 67. 71. 73. 79. 83. 89. 97. 101. 103. 107. 109. 113. 127. 131. 137. 139. 149. 151. 157. 163. 167. 173. 179. 181. 191. 193. 197. 199. 211. 223. 227. 229. 233. 239. 241. 251. 257. 263. 269. 271. 277. 281. 283. 293. 307. 311. 313. 317. 331. 337. 347. 349. 353. 359. 367. 373. 379. 383. 389. 397. 401. 409. 419. 421. 431. 433. 439. 443. 449. 457. 461. 463. 467. 479. 487. 491. 499. 503. 509. 521. 523. 541.] Alert The data file primes.txt should be saved in the same folder where the python program is saved. Otherwise you have to provide the full path of the primes.txt . For example if you have downloaded this file in the android mobile then the path will be primes = np . loadtxt ( \"/storage/emulated/0/Download/primes.txt\" , delimiter = \", \" ) In general you can obtain the path from the details or properties of the stored file. Warning The loadtxt function get only the data that can be converted into numbers. To get the data in other types we have to pass the type of data as an optional argument. For example to get data in strings we may use age_group = np . loadtxt ( \"fruits.txt\" , dtype = np . str ) Ex: Download the primes-exercise.txt and try to print the data as above. Ex: Download the statesandut.txt file contating the name of states and union terrotories of India and try to make list of this. 1.2 Multi Columns File \u00b6 Suppose we want to load a marks.csv that consist of two columns with a header as follows Roll No.,Marks 1 ,21 2 ,30 3 ,22 4 ,21 5 ,20 6 ,23 7 ,23 8 ,22 9 ,22 . . . To read each column as a separate list and skipping the first row, we can use the following, import numpy as np # we pass the skiprow=1 to skip the first row roll_no , marks = np . loadtxt ( \"marks.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , skiprows = 1 , unpack = True ) print ( roll_no , marks ) [ 1 . 2 . 3 . 4 . 5 . 6 . 7 . 8 . 9 . 10 . 11 . 12 . 13 . 14 . 15 . 16 . 17 . 18 . 19 . 20 . 21 . 22 . 23 . 24 . 25 . 26 . 27 . 28 . 29 . 30 . 31 . 32 . 33 . 34 . 35 . 36 . 37 . 38 . 39 . 40 . 41 . 42 . 43 . 44 . 45 . 46 . 47 . 48 . 49 . 50 . 51 . 52 . 53 . 54 . 55 . 56 . 57 . 58 . 59 . 60 . 61 . 62 . 63 . 64 . 65 . 66 . 67 . 68 . 69 . 70 . 71 . 72 . 73 . 74 . 75 . 76 . 77 . 78 . 79 . 80 . 81 . ] [ 21 . 30 . 22 . 21 . 20 . 23 . 23 . 22 . 22 . 25 . 21 . 23 . 21 . 23 . 24 . 22 . 21 . 23 . 23 . 21 . 28 . 30 . 29 . 27 . 25 . 23 . 25 . 23 . 29 . 22 . 21 . 26 . 30 . 22 . 22 . 20 . 23 . 23 . 23 . 30 . 21 . 22 . 30 . 28 . 28 . 24 . 21 . 24 . 25 . 23 . 24 . 24 . 26 . 23 . 25 . 24 . 28 . 23 . 25 . 20 . 22 . 29 . 26 . 25 . 24 . 24 . 30 . 30 . 24 . 25 . 29 . 28 . 30 . 25 . 27 . 30 . 24 . 30 . 28 . 24 . 30 . ] Tip To skip any number of rows from the top we pass the skiprows as an optional arguments. For example to skip top two rows of the data we can use roll_no , marks = np . loadtxt ( \"marks.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , skiprows = 2 , unpack = True ) To get a particular column we can pass the optional argument userow as follows marks = np . loadtxt ( \"marks.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , usecols = ( 1 ), useunpack = True ) 1.3 Plotting data \u00b6 Now we have imported the data from files as lists in python. Now we can plot using plot command, for example, the data from above files can be plotted using the following code import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt roll_no , marks = np . loadtxt ( \"marks.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , skiprows = 1 , unpack = True ) plt . plot ( roll_no , marks ) plt . xlabel ( \"Roll No.\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Marks\" ) plt . title ( \"Marks vs Roll No.\" ) plt . show () Tip We can also apply some functions on any list and then plot them. 2. Other type of Plots \u00b6 The default plot join all the points to make a plot which is not relevant all the time. For example joining all the points in the above graph doesn't make it relavant. Here we will see the examples of more types of plot in python. 2.1 Scatter plot \u00b6 In a scatter plot the data is displayed as a collection of points, each point determines the position on x and y axes. To make a scatter plot scatter function is used from the matplotlib.pyplot library. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt roll_no , marks = np . loadtxt ( \"marks.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , skiprows = 1 , unpack = True ) plt . scatter ( roll_no , marks , color = 'red' ) plt . xlabel ( \"Roll No.\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Marks\" ) plt . title ( \"Marks vs Roll No.\" ) plt . show () 2.2 Bar Graph \u00b6 A bar graph is in the python is plotted using the bar function in matplotlib.pyplot library. A simple example of bar graph is the following import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt langs = [ 'C' , 'C++' , 'Java' , 'Python' , 'PHP' ] students = [ 23 , 17 , 35 , 29 , 12 ] plt . bar ( langs , students ) plt . xlabel ( \"Programming Language\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Number of Students\" ) plt . title ( \"Number of Students in each Programming Language\" ) plt . show () A data on csv contains the number of COVID-19 cases according to age groups. Each age groups consist of 10 years. The head of the data looks like this Sno,AgeGroup,TotalCases,Percentage 1 ,0-9,22,3.18% 2 ,10-19,27,3.90% 3 ,20-29,172,24.86% 4 ,30-39,146,21.10% 5 ,40-49,112,16.18% 6 ,50-59,77,11.13% 7 ,60-69,89,12.86% 8 ,70-79,28,4.05% 9 ,> = 80 ,10,1.45% We can use 1 st and 3 rd column of the data to plot the following bar graph. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # getting the data in lists age_group = np . loadtxt ( \"agegroupcovid.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , skiprows = 1 , usecols = ( 1 ), unpack = True , dtype = np . str ) positive = np . loadtxt ( \"agegroupcovid.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , skiprows = 1 , usecols = ( 2 ), unpack = True ) # plotting the bar graph plt . bar ( age_group , positive , color = 'red' ) # adding attributes to the graph plt . xlabel ( \"Age Group\" ) plt . ylabel ( \"Positive CoVid-19 Cases\" ) plt . title ( \"COVID cases in each Age Group\" ) # showing the graph plt . show () 2.3 Pie Chart \u00b6 A pie chart is a circular chart divided into sectors,to illustrate numerical proportion. Pie chart is plotted using pie function from matplotlib.pyplot library. A simple pie chart can be plotted as import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt langs = [ 'C' , 'C++' , 'Java' , 'Python' , 'PHP' ] students = [ 23 , 17 , 35 , 29 , 12 ] plt . pie ( students , labels = langs ) plt . show () The COVID-19 example can also be represented in pie chart using the following code. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt age_group = np . loadtxt ( \"agegroupcovid.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , skiprows = 1 , usecols = ( 1 ), unpack = True , dtype = np . str ) positive = np . loadtxt ( \"agegroupcovid.csv\" , delimiter = ',' , skiprows = 1 , usecols = ( 2 ), unpack = True ) plt . pie ( positive , labels = age_group ) plt . title ( \"COVID cases in each Age Group\" ) plt . show () Ex: Make a plot of each type using any data of your choice. 3.

Strings 2.1 Accessing data inside list 2.2 Basic list operations 2.3 String Methods 2.4 Membership and Interating a String 3. References 1. List \u00b6 Till now we are using list to store data and plot them. Now today we will learn about it extensively. List is a data structure, means a way to store and access data. So today we will learn how to store and access data in list data structure. a list is a collection of data in a finite sequence. it can hold values of multiple datatype, i.e., one entry can be integer, other can float or string. 1.1 Creating lists \u00b6 A list is created using a square bracket as follows, a = [] # an empty list b = [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] # list of numbers c = [ \"sandeep\" , \"suman\" , 2020 , 7 ] # mix datatypes d = [[ \"sandeep\" , \"suman\" ], 2020 , []] # list inside list print ( c ) [ 'sandeep' , 'suman' , 2020 , 7 ] 1.2 Accessing data inside list \u00b6 Each entry has an index or position in a list, which can be used to access them. As counting starts in pyton from 0 , So the first index is 0 and second index is 1 and so on. c = [ 'sandeep' , 'suman' , 2020 , 7 ] print ( c [ 0 ]) # to get the 0th element (count with 0) print ( c [ 2 ]) # to get the 2nd element (count with 0) print ( c [ - 1 ]) # count from last sandeep 2020 7 1.3 Basic list operations \u00b6 Length: The length of a list can be computed as follows len ( c ) 4 Addition: Two or more lists can be added with + operation as follows a = [ 1 , 2 ] b = [ \"a\" , \"b\" ] c = a + b print ( c ) [ 1 , 2 , 'a' , 'b' ] Multiplication: Repeatition can be achieved with * operation as follows a = [ 'Hi' ] * 5 print ( a ) [ 'Hi' , 'Hi' , 'Hi' , 'Hi' , 'Hi' ] Slicing: A part of of list starting with i index and end before j can be obtained by List[i:j] , for example c = [ \"sandeep\" , \"suman\" , 2020 , 7 ] print ( c [ 1 : 3 ]) [ 'suman' , 2020 ] 1.4 List as Stack \u00b6 Stack is a data structure based on LIFO(Last in first out). Append: The append method on a list will add element in the end of the list. L = [] L . append ( 1 ) # 1 will be added to L L . append ( 2 ) # 2 will be added to L print ( L ) [ 1 , 2 ] Pop: The pop method on list will remove the element from the last. L = [ 1 , 2 ] L . pop () print ( L ) [ 1 ] The method pop also takes addition arguement to remove element from any given index. L = [ 1 , 2 ] L . pop ( 0 ) # removes the element with index 0 print ( L ) [ 2 ] 1.5 Other method on list \u00b6 Index: This method is used to get the index of an element. L = [ \"apple\" , \"mango\" , \"orange\" ] i = L . index ( \"mango\" ) print ( i ) 1 Remove: This method is used to remove an element in the list. L = [ \"apple\" , \"mango\" , \"orange\" ] L . remove ( \"mango\" ) print ( L ) [ 'apple' , 'orange' ] Reverse: This method will reverse the elements of the given list. L = [ \"apple\" , \"mango\" , \"orange\" ] L . reverse () print ( L ) [ 'orange' , 'mango' , 'apple' ] Sort: This method is used to sort the elements of a list. L = [ 4 , 6 , 2 , 7 , 1 , 3 ] L . sort () print ( L ) [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , 7 ] Tip The maximum element of a list can be obtained using sort taking in the last element. i.e., L = [ 4 , 6 , 2 , 7 , 1 , 3 ] L . sort () max = L [ - 1 ] print ( max ) 7 1.6 Membership and Interating of a List \u00b6 Like the membership in the set. We can tell if something is inside a list or not as follows L = [ \"apple\" , \"mango\" , \"orange\" ] print ( \"apple\" in L ) print ( \"guava\" in L ) True False Often in programming we want look for each element of a list one by one from start to finish. The process is generally known as iteration in programmin. A simple programm to iterate a list is as follows fruits = [ \"apple\" , \"mango\" , \"orange\" ] for i in fruits : # semicolon is used to make code block print ( i ) # 4 space is used here !important apple mango orange 2. Strings \u00b6 String is one the basic datatypes of the python language. There are many ways to define a string but we use the most common method by writing a sentence or paragraph inside single( ' ) or double( \" ) quotes. mystring = \"python is awesome\" mystring = 'python is awesome' print ( mystring ) python is awesome Warning Even numbers in single or double quotes behaves as an string. temp = \"38.7\" print ( type ( temp )) <class 'str' > 2.1 Accessing data inside list \u00b6 String behaves very much similar to the list. You can think that it is a list where each character has as index. We can obtain a character from its position or index. As counting starts in pyton from 0 , So the first index is 0 and second index is 1 and so on. mystring = \"python is awesome\" fifth = mystring [ 4 ] # fifth character from start last_fifth = mystring [ - 4 ] # fifth character from last print ( fifth , last_fifth ) o s 2.2 Basic list operations \u00b6 Length: The length of a string can be computed as follows print ( len ( mystring )) 17 Addition: Two or more string can be added with + operation as follows a = \"Sandeep \" b = \"Suman\" c = a + b print ( c ) Sandeep Suman Multiplication: Repeatition can be achieved with * operation as follows a = 'Hi!' * 5 print ( a ) Hi!Hi!Hi!Hi!Hi! Slicing: A part of of string starting with i index and end before j can be obtained by List[i:j] , for example c = \"sandeep\" print ( c [ 1 : 4 ]) # start from 1st and end before 4th (counting starts with 0) print ( c [ 4 :]) # everything after 4th (counting starts with 0) print ( c [: 4 ]) # to get the substring from start and end before 4th (counting starts with 0) and eep sand Extended Slicing: The slicing in string is more flexible as it accepts more than two arguments. For example X[1:10:2] will get every other item in the substring X[1:10] univ = \"TilkaManjhiBhagalpurUniversity\" s1 = univ [ 1 : 20 : 2 ] # get even postion elements in substring univ[1:20] s2 = univ [:: 2 ] # get even postion elements s3 = univ [:: - 1 ] # reverse the string print ( s ) ikMnhBaapr TlaajihgluUiest ytisrevinUruplagahBihjnaMakliT 2.3 String Methods \u00b6 Some of the string method is the following Capitalize: This method is used make first letter capital. msg = \"Welcome to FaculTy DevelpMent prograMME.\" print ( msg . capitalize ()) Welcome to faculty develpment programme. Lower: It will make every letter small. msg = \"Welcome to FaculTy DevelpMent prograMME.\" print ( msg . lower ()) welcome to faculty develpment programme. Replace: It will one substring with another. msg = \"Welcome to FaculTy DevelpMent prograMME.\" print ( msg . replace ( \"M\" , \"X\" )) # replace all M with X Welcome to FaculTy DevelpXent prograXXE. To replace only one instance, we can pass one more argumnet. msg = \"Welcome to FaculTy DevelpMent prograMME.\" print ( msg . replace ( \"M\" , \"X\" , 1 )) # replace the first M with X Welcome to FaculTy DevelpXent prograMME. Find: It will find one string in another string. msg = \"Welcome to FaculTy DevelpMent prograMME.\" print ( msg . find ( \"to\" )) # finds the position of \"to\" 8 You can think of this as the following msg = \"Welcome to FaculTy DevelpMent prograMME.\" position = msg . find ( \"to\" ) # positin of to original = msg [: 8 ] + \"to\" + msg [ 8 + 2 :] # the original msg print ( original ) Welcome to FaculTy DevelpMent prograMME. Split: The split method will convert a string to list of substring msg = \"Welcome to FaculTy DevelpMent prograMME.\" L = msg . split () # default method will split at each whitespace print ( L ) [ 'Welcome' , 'to' , 'FaculTy' , 'DevelpMent' , 'prograMME.' ] The split method is much more flexible. We can pass an argument to tell about the marker for split. msg = \"Amar,Akbar,Anthony\" L = msg . split ( \",\" ) # split each part with \",\" print ( L ) [ 'Amar' , 'Akbar' , 'Anthony' ] Join: The join method works opposite of split. We can make a string using the split method. L = [ 'Amar' , 'Akbar' , 'Anthony' ] msg = \" \" . join ( L ) # the string in between will go before \".\" print ( msg ) Amar Akbar Anthony If we want to join with , in all the elements of the list. L = [ 'Amar' , 'Akbar' , 'Anthony' ] msg = \",\" . join ( L ) print ( msg ) Amar,Akbar,Anthony Ex: Try to join the list L with comma and space. Ex: Try to join in smaller latter. Tip There are huge number of list methods in python, and python programming is cosidered to be very powerful in list manupulation. You can google search to do any kind of list manupulation. 2.4 Membership and Interating a String \u00b6 Membership tells if a string is a part of larger string or not. print ( \"T\" in \"TMBU\" ) print ( \"math\" in \"mathematics\" ) print ( \"ss\" in \"sandeep\" ) True True False The iteration in string work similar to list as follows univ = \"TMBU\" for i in univ : print ( i ) T M B U Ex: Write a program to check if the word 'orange' is present in the \"This is orange juice\". Ex: Convert the date written in the format \"10/06/2020\" to \"10-06-2020\". Ex: Convert \"Tilka MaJHi BHaGalPUR UNIVersiYy\" to \"Tilka Manjhi Bhagalpur University\". 3.

Here d denote the data type of float. For other datatype you can use the following table.

Hence they are implemented in every programmming language. Actully these concepts make a programming language different from calculators. DAY 5 1. Boolean 1.1 Assigning Boolean Data 1.2 Boolean Operations 2. Conditional Statements 2.1 General Structure 2.2 Implementation 3. Loops 3.1 While loop 3.2 For Loop 3.2.1 Conditionally Controlling the loop 3.3 Range Function 4. References 1. Boolean \u00b6 Since we have seen that control structure depends on test . Test is nothing but a statement in pyton whose value is either True or False but not together. For this we have a data type in python to represent this, known as boolean data type. 1.1 Assigning Boolean Data \u00b6 test1 = True test2 = False print ( test1 ) print ( test2 ) True False Many relational operation result in boolean in pyton. For example if we ask following questions? test1 = 5 >= 0 # True test2 = 5 < 0 # False test3 = 6 == 3 # False test4 = ( 6 / 2 == 3 ) # Ture, use bracket for better looks print ( test1 ) print ( test2 ) print ( test3 ) print ( test4 ) True False False True We can also check some variable has a particular value or not using this idea. f_name = \"Sandeep\" l_name = \"Suman\" full_name = f_name + \" \" + l_name test1 = ( full_name == \"Sandeep Suman\" ) print ( test1 ) True 1.2 Boolean Operations \u00b6 Boolean data has three main operation. Others are combination of them not: It interchange the value of boolean between True and False . or: It takes the logical or operation between two boolean statements. and: It takes the logical and operation between two boolean statements. The result can be summarized in a table as follows A B not A not B A == B A =! B A or B A and B T F F T F T T F F T T F F T T F T T F F T F T T F F T T T F F F f_name = \"Sandeep\" l_name = \"Suman\" full_name = f_name + \" \" + l_name test1 = ( full_name == \"Sandeep Suman\" ) # True test2 = not test1 # not True = False test3 = ( full_name == \"Sandeep Suman\" ) or ( 5 <= 0 ) # True OR False = True test4 = ( full_name == \"Sandeep Suman\" ) and ( 5 <= 0 ) # True AND False = False print ( test1 ) print ( test2 ) print ( test3 ) print ( test4 ) True False True False 2. Conditional Statements \u00b6 Till now all the lines of a program run one by one. The control structure will enable us to run a line based on a test . 2.1 General Structure \u00b6 The structure of general control struructure in python(or in any programming language) will look like the following: if < test1 > : < statement1 > elif < test2 > : < statement2 > . . . else : < final statement > The situation can graphically represented as the following diagram If we look at another perspective we can think this as the following sequnce of tests When the i-th test fails, then program check for (i+1)-th test and so on. If any test say k-th one will pass then the program will run the k-th statement will run and program will exit this control structure. If all the statement fails the program will run the final statement nested under else . 2.2 Implementation \u00b6 Except the first if statement all other are optional. We can combine as many test as we want. One Test: The smallest possible program with if statement can written as following number = 77 if number > 60 : # colon represent a block in python print ( \"1st Devision\" ) # each block need to be indented by 4 whitespace 1st Devision The output is expected. But even if the number \\leq 60 , we will not get any output because the code has no else statement. number = 55 if number > 60 : print ( \"1st Devision\" ) If...else: We can combine else to catch the program when test fails as follows number = 55 if number > 60 : print ( \"1st Devision\" ) else : print ( \"Not 1st Division\" ) Not 1st Division Elif: More than one test can be used using elif statement. number = 37 if number >= 60 : print ( \"1st Devision\" ) elif number >= 45 : print ( \"2nd Division\" ) elif number >= 35 : print ( \"Third Division\" ) else : print ( \"Fail\" ) Third Division Ex: Change the number to get each type of output. Ex: Write a program that will give the grade of a student based on marks. You can use any criteria for grade. 3. Loops \u00b6 Loops are used to run a block of code again and again based on some condition. There are two kinds of loops most programming language have. While Loop For Loops 3.1 While loop \u00b6 In python while loop is used to run a block of code again and again till a test is true. A simple example of such code is the following. i = 1 while i < 6 : # code in this block run repeatedly print ( i ) i += 1 >>> 1 2 3 4 5 3.2 For Loop \u00b6 A for loop in python is used to iterate over a sequence (list ,tuple, string) or other iterable objects. A simple for loop to print each element of the following numbers = [ 6 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 5 ] # given list for iteration for val in numbers : # this code block will run for print ( val ) # each element of iterable 6 5 3 8 4 2 5 A common situation in which for loop is used to store the value of a computation for each element of a list. Suppose we want to find sum of each element of a list, then we can write the following code. numbers = [ 6 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 5 ] # given iterable sum = 0 # final value will be stored in sum for val in numbers : # this code will run each element of list sum = sum + val # we add each element in our sum variable # after leaving for loop look at indentation print ( sum ) # finally print the sum 33 3.2.1 Conditionally Controlling the loop \u00b6 The for loop does not require any test to be performed in the code. But these are theree important cases where for is used with a condition. break: It will terminates the loop based on a test . A common use case is suppose you want to search for some property of element of a list. Then we will break the loop once the condition is met. For example suppose we are looking for number 5 in the given list of numbers. numbers = [ 6 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 5 ] # given iterable for val in numbers : # this code will run each element of list if val == 3 : # the for loop will run until this test is satisfied break print ( val ) 6 5 Important You can see that the code will run until the test is satisfied for the first time. continue: It is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration. A common situation is suppose we want to print odd integers only in a given list, then we can skip a code block for even integer as follows numbers = [ 6 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 5 ] # given iterable for val in numbers : # this code will run each element of list if val % 2 == 0 : # checks for even value and continue # leave the current iteration print ( val ) 5 3 5 pass: It is a null statement. The statements results into no operation. when it is executed,nothing happens. It is useful as a placeholder,when a statement is required syntactically,but no codes need to be executed. For example we can achieve the above task with the following code with pass . numbers = [ 6 , 5 , 3 , 8 , 4 , 2 , 5 ] # given iterable for val in numbers : # this code will run each element of list if val % 2 == 0 : # checks for even value and pass # leave the current iteration else : print ( val ) 5 3 5 3.3 Range Function \u00b6 In loops, range is used to control how many times the loop will be repeated. It is used to generate a finite sequence of natural numbers based on three arguemnts. First and last argument is optional. The range function looks like range ( start , stop , step ) start states the integer value at which the sequence begins, if this is not included then start begins at 0 stop is always required and is the integer that is counted up to but not included step sets how much to increase (or decrease in the case of negative numbers) the next iteration, if this is omitted then step defaults to 1 So the range function can be used in three different ways Using Stop Only: We can use the range as only one argument as a positive natural number say n . It will make a iterable of n natural numbers starting with 0 . For example for i in range ( 5 ): print ( i ) 0 1 2 3 4 Using start and stop: We can use range function with two arguemnts start and stop . It will create a iterable of stop - start natural numbers with start . For example for i in range ( 5 , 10 ): # create iterable start with print ( i ) # 5 of length 10 - 5 = 5 5 6 7 8 9 Using start, stop and step: When all three arguement used, it generate a iterable that will began with natural number start to stop - 1 with a step . For example for i in range ( 1 , 20 , 3 ): print ( i ) 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 Warning The range doesn't make a list. i.e., if you run this code the output will not be a sequence. sequence = range ( 1 , 20 , 3 ) print ( sequence ) range ( 1 , 20 , 3 ) In order to get the list. You have to pass this iterable in list function. sequence = range ( 1 , 20 , 3 ) list_sequence = list ( sequence ) print ( list_sequence ) [ 1 , 4 , 7 , 10 , 13 , 16 , 19 ] 4.
